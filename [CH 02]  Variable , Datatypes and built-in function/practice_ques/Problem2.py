# Problem 2) Write a python program to find remainder when a number is divided by z

num = int(input("ENTER NUMBER : "))   # to take number from the user 
z = int(input("ENTER DIVISOR : "))    # to take divisor i.e (number with which we have to divide number)

print("THE REMAINDER IS : ", num%z)   # printing the remainder
