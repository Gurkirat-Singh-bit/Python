# here i learnt the introduction of strings 

a = 'Gukirat Singh'                    # single quote string

b = "Gurkirat Singh"                   # double quote string

c =  '''Gurkirat Singh'''              # triple single quote string

d =  """Gurkirat Singh"""              # triple double quote string 

 #  triple single and double quote is used for multiline strings

'''also this is used for taking commments in python  multiline comments'''
