# here i got introduced with loops in python

print(1)
print(2)               # what is we have to print 1 to 5
print(3)               # we usually do this 
print(4)               # what if we have to print 1 to 1000
print(5)               # is it a too diffiult to do , as showen


# instead of this we can use loop
# same task is done with this loop
for i in range(6):
    print(i)

# also difficult task is also done like this in just 2 line of code
for i in range(10001):
    print(i)
