# here i learnt pass statement in python and how to use pass in python


for i in range(10):                         # unfinished  loop 

    pass                                    # here pass is used for telling python to forgot this loop for now



for i in range(10000000):                       # normal nested loop

    print("JAI MAHADEV")                        # to print JAI MAHADEV 9999999 times
