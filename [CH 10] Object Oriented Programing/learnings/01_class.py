# here i learnt classes in python

class employee:                               # Define a class named 'employee'

    language = "python and c"                 # Class attribute 'language' with value "python and c"

    salary = 10000000                         # Class attribute 'salary' with value 10000000

employee1 = employee()                        # Create an instance of 'employee' named 'employee1'

employee1.name = "gurkirat singh"             # Assign the name "gurkirat singh" to 'employee1'

print(employee1.salary, employee1.language)   # Print the salary and language of 'employee1'


employee2 = employee()                        # Create another instance of 'employee' named 'employee2'

employee2.name = "rohan sharma"               # Assign the name "rohan sharma" to 'employee2'

print(employee2.salary, employee2.language)   # Print the salary and language of 'employee2'

# class is a blueprint for creating objects imagine it like a form

# object is an instance of a class just like a filled form

# the word instance means an example of something
