# here i learned different types of datatypes in python 


a = 10                   # this is an integer datatype 

b = 1.9999               # this is a float datatype

c = "Gurkirat singh"     # this is a string datatype  

d = False                # this is a boolean datatype

e = None                 # this is a none datatype

# a, b , c , d and e are variable
# variable are like boxes in memory which stores data
# and the type of data it store , is its datatype
