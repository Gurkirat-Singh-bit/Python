# here i learnt how to use list with while loop 

zist = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9.0,"gurkirat","vansh",876]         # intialising a list

i = 0                                                       # intialsing an iterater for while loop

while(i<len(zist)):                                         # while loop initialising the conditon whith length of list

    print(zist[i])                                          # printing thr ith index of list

    i = i + 1                                               # updating i
