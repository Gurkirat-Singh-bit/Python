# here i learnt methods of tuples

tuple = (1,222,345,5323,673,677,673)           # intialising a tuple

print(len(tuple))                          # same as list using len funtion to check its length

print(tuple.index(345))                    # index used to check the position of data in tuple

print(tuple.count(673))                    # count the repition of data
