# here i learnt conditional expression 
# by example of checking whether user is adult of not by age 


age = int(input("ENTER YOUR AGE  : "))                      # taking age from the user


if(age>=18):                                                # ths is 'if' condition used for condition

    print("YOU ARE ADULT")                                  # here its age>=18 if it true then it print adult

else:                                                       # this is else if the condition in "if" is false 

    print("YOU ARE NOT ADULT")                              # then it executes and print not adult

print("END OF PROGRAM")                                     # this is not the part of the program
