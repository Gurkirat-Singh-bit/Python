# problem 2) print table of 5 in REPL (without using loop just normal)

# whats is REPL
# REPL stands for Read, Eval, Print, and Loop.
# It represents the core cycle of the Python language shell. 
# This guide provides a deep dive into using the Python Interactive Shell 
# and helps beginners and intermediates in their Python learning journey.



# unfortunately there is no code required here 
# but we have to open cmd or powershell or terminal below
# then type python
# after typing python REPL is activated can use to run 
# single line code or to perform arithmetic calculation


# enjoy :)
