# here i am going to learn about sets

s = {1,2,3,4,2,43,42,4,24,44,223,3455,11,2,1,23,2,4,5,5} # this is a set 

empty_s = set()                                          # this is an empty set , s = {} creates empty dictionary
 
print(s)                                                 # benefit of sets is item can't repeats
