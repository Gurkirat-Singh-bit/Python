# here i learnt how to index a list 

friends = ["chatgpt","vansh","finch", 100]  

print(friends[1:3])           # list can be accessed same as strings 

print(friends[2:])            # just like string starting  from 1 to the last

print(friends[:3])            # same here starting from begining to 3
