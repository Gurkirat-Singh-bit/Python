# here i am going to learn list in python

friends = ["chatgpt","vansh","finch", 100]      # this is a list that stores mutiple things

friends[0] = "bard"                             # aslike strings , lists are mutable means that they can change in runtime
 
print(friends[0])                               # printing the element from the list
